# pure-python
Pyton tools that do things.  search+replace.py is interactive.  It scans a text file, searching it for a string and then replacing it with another string.  
ssh-paramiko-1.py  sshes to a machine and executes a few commands as if at the command line.  Output goes to the screen but can be captured and further processed.  
ssh.py does the same thing without the ssh module.  Which is better in terms of performance?
