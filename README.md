Pyton tools that do things.  search+replace.py scans is interactive.  It scans a text file, searching it for a string and then replacing it with a string.  
ssh-paramiko-1.py  sshes to a machine and executes a few commands as if at the command line.  Output goes to the screen but can be captured and further processed.
